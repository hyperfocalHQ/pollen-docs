  Pollen v5 introduced several breaking changes to fix unintuitive behavior and
  lay stronger foundations for the future
---

# v4 -> v5

## Breaking changes

* The `pollen-css` library is now ESM-only, not CommonJS
* Dropped support for < Node v16
* CSS import moved to `/pollen.css` rather than default package export
* Properties keys in `module`s are no longer converted from `camelCase` to `kebab-case` when generating CSS variables
* Default color palette has been replaced with a much more robust and extensive palette, adapted from Tailwind's
* Deprecated modules `elevation` and `easing` removed, replaced by the new modules introduced in v4 (`shadow` and `ease` respectfully)

## Migration Guide

1. If you're using the default CSS from Pollen, update your import path from `pollen-css` to `pollen-css/pollen.css`
2. Ensure you're using Node v16+
3. If you have your own config, update any `camelCase` property names to be `kebeb-case`
4. If you are using Pollen's default color palette, get the output from v4 (in JSON format for easier migration) and add it to custom config in v5, since the default palette has changed significantly
5. If you are still using the deprecated default modules `--elevation` or `--easing` update them to `--shadow` and `--ease` respevitvely
